	<h2>julia hedrick</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;My name is Julia Hedrick. I was born and raised in a Long Island suburb with my older sister and my parents. Sounds cliche, but my biggest support and role model is my mom. I grew up watching her work hard every day to achieve her goals and improve her skills within her career. It has, without a doubt, had an impact on the way I work on a day to day basis, but also the way I put goals into action. I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am very excited to be spending my summer in Cambridge, Massachusetts as an Engineering Practicum Intern at the Google campus. I will be working with a back end team and I am very eager and excited to learn everything I can.

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;In my free time, I like to spend time with friends, listen to music, and try new foods. Going to school so close to Boston has really allowed me to venture out and try new things. I also like to explore all the museums in the area. I'd have to say that my favorite is definitely the Museum of Fine Arts.
