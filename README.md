comp20 assignment 1

This assignment was to create a portfolio website with three files: index.html, resume.html, and bio.html. The style sheet used is named style.css with at least 5 rules.

To my understanding, all aspects of my code are correctly implemented.

I have not collaborated with anyone nor have I discussed this assignment with anyone. 

I spent approximately 4 hours completing this assignment.
